# AWC Wildlife Detection & Classification Configuration
# =====================================================
# This file contains settings for running the inference pipeline.
# Adjust paths and thresholds according to your setup.


# REQUIRED SETTINGS:

# Path to the MegaDetector model weights file (.pt)
detector_path: "models/md_v1000.0.0-redwood.pt"

# Path to the species classifier model weights file (.pth)
classifier_path: "models/awc-135-v1.pth"

# Path to the labels file (text file with one species name per line)
label_path: "labels.txt"


# OPTIONAL SETTINGS:

# Output file name (without extension) to be saved in the image directory. Creates both .csv and .json files.
# Can also be a full path like "path/to/my_output"
output_name: "results"

# Detection confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
# Lower = more detections but potentially more false positives
# Recommended: 0.1 to 0.2
detection_threshold: 0.1

# Classification confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0)  
# Only predictions above this threshold will be included in results
# Recommended: 0.5
classification_threshold: 0.5

# Number of top predictions to return per detection
# Use 1 for just the best prediction, or higher to see alternatives
topn: 1

# Batch size for classification (number of crops processed at once)
# Higher = faster processing but uses more GPU memory
# Reduce if you get out-of-memory errors
classification_batch_size: 4

# Save logs to a timestamped file (true/false)
# Set to false for console output only
save_log: false
